## Changes in 2.0.4:

- **Modified `api_client.py`**:
    - Added TrueNAS Scale auto-detection
    - Implemented a "curl-first" strategy that uses curl for the initial connection
    - Added options to continue using curl for all operations on TrueNAS Scale
    - Created a smoother fallback mechanism
- **Improved `dns_manager.py`**:
    - Added timeout handling for Unbound reconfiguration
    - Implemented a thread-based approach to prevent reconfiguration from hanging
    - Added automatic fallback to restart if reconfiguration times out
    - Improved error handling for all DNS operations

# Changes in 2.0.3: 
- **Modular API Client**: Split the API client into multiple modules following the minimalist multi-module pattern:
    - `api_client_core.py`: Base functionality and configuration
    - `api_client_requests.py`: Primary implementation using requests
    - `api_client_alt.py`: Alternative implementation using curl
    - `api_client.py`: Wrapper that selects the appropriate implementation
- **Socket-Level Timeout Management**:
    - Explicitly set socket timeouts before requests
    - Restore original socket timeout afterward
    - Configure connect and read timeouts separately
- **Connection Resilience**:
    - Improved error handling and retry logic
    - Backoff strategy for reconnection attempts
    - Configurable recovery parameters
- **Protocol Optimizations**:
    - Option to force HTTP/1.1 (which appears more reliable)
    - Configurable SSL verification
- **Optimized Docker Compose**:
    - Platform-specific configuration for TrueNAS Scale
    - Well-documented environment variables

# Changes in 2.0.1:
- Detailed debugging for api session

# Changes in 2.0.0:
- **Batched DNS Updates**:
    - Instead of making a separate API call for each DNS entry, we batch them together and make a single API call
    - This significantly reduces the number of Unbound restarts
- **Rate Limiting**:
    - Added minimum intervals between API calls and Unbound reconfiguration
    - Enforces a cooldown period after each reconfiguration
- **Improved Error Handling**:
    - Better handling of connection failures
    - Graceful recovery from Unbound restarts
    - Fallback mechanisms when reconfiguration fails
- **Caching**:
    - DNS entries are cached to reduce redundant API calls
    - Intelligent cache invalidation when entries are added/removed
- **Logging Improvements**:
    - Configurable log levels via environment variables
    - More structured and informative logs
