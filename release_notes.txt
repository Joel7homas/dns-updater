# Changes in 2.0.0:
- **Batched DNS Updates**:
    - Instead of making a separate API call for each DNS entry, we batch them together and make a single API call
    - This significantly reduces the number of Unbound restarts
- **Rate Limiting**:
    - Added minimum intervals between API calls and Unbound reconfiguration
    - Enforces a cooldown period after each reconfiguration
- **Improved Error Handling**:
    - Better handling of connection failures
    - Graceful recovery from Unbound restarts
    - Fallback mechanisms when reconfiguration fails
- **Caching**:
    - DNS entries are cached to reduce redundant API calls
    - Intelligent cache invalidation when entries are added/removed
- **Logging Improvements**:
    - Configurable log levels via environment variables
    - More structured and informative logs
